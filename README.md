# Who Discussion

[Who](https://who.eloleo.io/) is a website established some time before time began in 1970 with wide appeal to everyone who enjoys programming, design, cs theory, old hoodies without logos, retro artificial intelligence, yarn arts but not knitting, and amigurumi dinosaurs that fit in a cupholder.

This repo is for ~~issues~~ ~~complaints~~ ~~comments~~ ~~cat conspiracies~~ discussion about things on [Who](https://who.eloleo.io/).

Join us in the [Issues](https://github.com/nomnomnomnom/who-discussion/issues) for riveting debates.
